# Linked Connections Client for javascript

Status: _not functional (first dummy results)_

A javascript library to use intermodal route planning advice in the browser or in your nodejs applications.

## Install and use it

Install it:
```bash
npm install lc-client #for adding it to your $PATH add -g
```

When you get this error while installing:
``` ../lib/kerberos.h:5:27: fatal error: gssapi/gssapi.h: No such file or directory
Solution
``` sudo apt-get install libkrb5-dev

For use on the command line:
```bash
# uses by default the config-example.json which comes with this repo
lcc -c config.json '{}'
```

Use it as a library:
```bash
var Client = require('lc-client');
var planner = new Client({"entrypoints" : ["http://belgianrail.linkedconnections.org/"]});
var resultStream = planner.query({"query":"object"});
resultStream.on('data', function (path) {
    console.log(path);
});
```

Using it in the browser works in a similar way, by e.g., using browserify to generate a build file that can be used in the browser
```bash
browserify lib/lc-client.js -d -p [minifyify --no-map] > dist/build.js
```

## How it works

The Linked Connections client plans routes over Linked Connections. These are hydra-powered hypermedia APIs that describe their things uisng the Linked Connections vocabulary. Furthermore, the objects returned in the document are ordere by departureTime.

The Client will start downloading schedule data from publicly available and discoverable locations on the Web. It will follow links to discover new documents.
